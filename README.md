# üì± Apple Phone Showcase with GSAP Animation and 3D Models

Welcome to the **Apple Phone Showcase** project! This interactive showcase features high-quality 3D models of Apple phones, enhanced with **GSAP animations** to provide a seamless and engaging experience. Built with **React.js** and **Three.js**, the site delivers an immersive way to explore the design and functionality of Apple devices.

## üéâ Features

- **3D Model Integration**: Showcase of high-quality, responsive 3D models of Apple phones, enabling a realistic representation.
- **Smooth Animations**: Interactive and fluid animations powered by **GSAP** for rotations, transitions, and effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Component-Based Structure**: Leveraging React's modular approach, components are reusable and organized for easy scalability.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Sleek transitions, smooth animations, and a polished design for a superior user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The framework used to build the dynamic, component-based user interface.
- **GSAP**: Powers advanced animations and seamless transitions for the 3D models and page interactions.
- **Three.js** (or other 3D libraries): Handles rendering and interactions for 3D models.
- **SCSS/CSS**: Styles the application and ensures responsive design across various devices.
